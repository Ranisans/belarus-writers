      Born on June 25 (July 7), 1882 in the village of Vyazynka (now Molodechno
      district of the Minsk region of Belarus) in the Belarusian Catholic family
      of Dominik Onufrievich Lutsevich and Benigna Ivanovna Lutsevich (virgin
      Volosevich). Parents were impoverished Belarusian noblemen who rented land
      in landowners' lands. The Lutsevich family was known since the beginning
      of the 17th century. The poet’s grandfather rented land from the
      Radziwills, but was expelled from their homes by them. This fact formed
      the basis of the Kupala drama "Raskidane na gnazhesto." В детстве будущему
      поэту приходилось помогать отцу, который, несмотря на своё шляхетское
      происхождение, по сути принадлежал к числу безземельных крестьян и
      вынужден был обрабатывать съёмные участки (у Здзеховских и др.), платя
      крупные суммы в качестве аренды за использование угодий. After the death
      of his father in 1902, he worked as a home teacher, a clerk in a landowner
      estate, a clerk and other work. The questionnaire of the conscript
      Lutsevich Ivan Dominicovich discovered in the Belarusian National
      Historical Archive indicates his religion - Roman Catholic and nationality
      - Russian [3]. Yanka Kupala entered the people's university in September,
      but his general mobilization announced in connection with the onset of the
      First World War prevented him from continuing his studies. Already at the
      beginning of 1916, the poet student was drafted into the army and he
      entered the road construction detachment, in which he worked until the
      onset of the events of the October Revolution.

      The first works of Kupala are several lyric poems in Polish, published in
      1903-1904 in the journal Ziarno (Grain) under the pseudonym K-a. The first
      poem in Belarusian - “May share” dates from July 15, 1904. The poem
      "Muzhik", published in 1905 in the Minsk newspaper "North-Western
      Territory", can be considered a successful debut in print and the
      beginning of the ascent of Yanka Kupala to the literary Belarusian
      Olympus. His early poems are typical of folklore in 19th-century
      Belarusian poetry.  Since 1907, Yanka Kupala begins the first short-term
      cooperation with the newspaper Nasha Niva. In 1906-1907, the poems were
      written “To Winter” (Winter), “To Anyone” (To No One), “Advance by
      Kahannem” (Payment by Love), on December 18, 1908, “Our Niva” published
      the poem “At Pilipak”. In the same year, work was completed on the poems
      "The Eternal Song" and "For what?" The theme of these works is social
      injustice and the oppression of the landlords.

      In 1908, the first collection of Kupala was published in St. Petersburg
      under the name "Zhaleyka" ("Pipe"). At the end of the year, the St.
      Petersburg Committee on Press Affairs under the Ministry of Internal
      Affairs decided to confiscate the collection as anti-state, and bring its
      author to justice. Soon, the arrest was withdrawn, but in 1909 the
      circulation of the book was again confiscated, already at the order of the
      Vilnius Governor-General. In order not to spoil the reputation of Nasha
      Niva, Kupala stopped working in the editorial office. Nevertheless, the
      Petersburg period of his life and work can be called one of the most
      successful and productive: primarily because Janke Kupala had the
      opportunity to make acquaintances with many representatives of the
      Belarusian intelligentsia, for example, Yakub Kolas and E. Pashkevich, who
      worked under the pseudonym Totka, who took shape as a poet and gained fame
      by the beginning of the 1910s. Back in Vilna, the poet met with the
      outstanding figure of Russian symbolism V. Ya. Bryusov, who drew attention
      to the actively published author and expressed a genuine interest in his
      poetic work. Later, Bryusov and Yanka Kupala continued to work closely at
      literary meetings in St. Petersburg; Bryusov became the first Russian
      author to start translating the Belarusian poet into Russian.

      With the onset of the Soviet era, the lyrical mood of Yanka Kupala
      underwent some changes. In the foreground in his poems came the motive of
      expectation of a brighter future; the poet had sincere hopes for
      fundamental changes in the life of the Belarusian people under the
      influence of the new era. Over the next two decades (until the onset of
      World War II), the following lyric collections of the Belarusian poet were
      published: “Inheritance” (1922), “Nameless” (1925), “Song of Construction”
      (1936), “Order-Bearing Belarus” (1937 ), “From the Heart” (1940), the poem
      “Over the River Oressa” (1933), “Tarasova Lobe” (1939) and some others
      Portrait of Yanka Kupala painted by Jacob Kruger, 1923 Despite the
      publication of optimistic poetry collections, relations between the
      Belarusian poet and the Soviet regime were mixed. The methodical
      persecution of the poet began after the accusation of unreliability:
      allegedly during the difficult historical period of the late 1910s, Yanka
      Kupala strongly supported the Organization of National Liberation of
      Belarus and “tarnished” himself by joining it. The play "Tuteyshyya" was
      banned for nationalism. Her translation into Polish provoked a protest
      from Polish chauvinists.

      During the war years, the bright journalism of Yanka Kupala, which was
      able to ignite people for battle, gained popularity - its new patriotic
      poems in this period had an anti-fascist orientation. Having left Minsk,
      Yanka Kupala settled in Pechishchi, a small village near Kazan, in order
      to find peace for immersion in anti-fascist journalism.

      Yanka Kupala died on June 28, 1942 at the Moscow Hotel. The poet fell into
      a flight of stairs between the 9th and 10th floors of the hotel, death was
      instant. There are rumors that the death could not be accidental; there
      were versions of suicide or murder involving special services [5].
      According to one version, at the time of the death of the poet a woman was
      seen with him. Allegedly, it was Pavlina Myadyolka: a friend of youth, the
      first performer of the role of Pavlinka. Yanka Kupala was originally
      buried at the Vagankovsky cemetery in Moscow. In 1962, his ashes were
      transferred to Minsk and reburied at the Military Cemetery, next to the
      grave of his mother (who died the day after her son, whose death she did
      not know in occupied Minsk). A large memorial has been erected over the
      grave of Yanka Kupala, as well as Yakub Kolas, buried nearby.
